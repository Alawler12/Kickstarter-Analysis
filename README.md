## Analyzing Kickstarter Data for Insight Into Campaign Success and Failure

### The purpose of this analysis was to help a client, Louise, gain a greater understanding of data accumulated regarding Kickstarter campaigns, so that she could move forward with her own campaign with a greater understanding of how to succeed in her efforts.  In this analysis, we looked specifically at data regarding *launch dates* and *fundraising goals.*

## Analysis and Challenges
I completed this analysis by sorting and clarifying the data to show the correlation between a campaign's success in reaching it's fundraising goal and:
- the start date of the campaign
- the stated dollar amount of the fundraising goal.

### Launch Date Analysis
To determine the relationship between the campaign's success and it's start date, I created a pivot table from the main dataset to analyze the outcome of the campaign relative to the month of the year in which it started.  I also created a chart to visualize the pivot table.  I filtered this data to specifically look at Kickstarter campaigns for theater only.  The challenge for this part of the project was using a pivot table and chart, having only limited experience before this time.  After some experimentation, I was able to get the table to dicplay the appropriate information and I was also able to format both the table and chart to look how I like in terms of colors and line weights.
